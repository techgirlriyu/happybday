        Wishing you a very happy birthday my sweet princess!~ 
    <br>
    <br>It's your first birthday with me...I really wanted to do something special for you. 
So I learned new codings for designing and animations and made this for you.
    <br>
    <br>There's a lot such ready-made links people post on instagram. You must've seen those. 
But I want you to know I didn't take any codes or anything from those. 
This whole thing that you're seeing...I made it all by myself. I designed it just for you. 
So I hope you liked this little present ᥫ᭡
    <br>
    <br>I'm not gonna say any cheesy stuff here. So I'd just like to say enjoy your life always.
 Don't ever worry about growing up. I know how you feel about this but as I've always told you...
 no matter how old we get we can always keep that little kid alive in us. And I want you to do the same. 
 I'm always here with you and I'll make sure you do that ᥫ᭡

    <br>
    <br>Thank you for stumbling into my life and becoming a special part of it, for letting me feel what
 a sweet relationship feels like, for loving me always, for everything. Let's be together forever!~

    <br>
    <br>I love you so much my silly crakehead~
